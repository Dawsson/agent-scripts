# /fixissue

Purpose: fix an issue end-to-end, with tests and proper follow-through.

Do (in order):
1) Take your time, fix it properly, refactor if necessary.
2) Add regression tests and run them.
3) Add a changelog entry.
4) Commit via `committer`, pull, and push.
5) Comment on the issue with what changed and close it.
   - If using `.issues/` tracker: `bun scripts/issues.ts status <id> done`
   - If using GitHub Issues: `gh issue comment <num> --body "…"` + `gh issue close <num>`

If the issue URL/number isn't provided, ask for it before the changelog/comment steps.

Location: `.claude/commands/fixissue.md` (repo-local) or `~/.claude/commands/fixissue.md` (global).
